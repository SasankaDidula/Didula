Hi!
I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.
Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.
Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?
Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?
White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?
I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.
Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!
Hi!
Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?
A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 
Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?
cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles
haha
I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.
No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.
Two days ago. It was a tough one.

Hi!
It is pretty good. 
My day is okay. 
went to gym
No, I am just a starter.
I go everyday. In fact, I'm in a running challenge.
It's actually not that impressive. I can only run. I cannot lift weight.
Oh that's a really interesting idea.
hi 
nothing much
content 
yeah gtg now
Hi!

ah I'm waiting to finish work earlier to meet my son at home

Just by myself. I love seeing movies by myself, it's the best.
Exactly. Exactly! Plus, I don't have to share the popcorn with anyone.

im scared I will fail
ohh
okay. Thankyou
Hi!
Just chillin'. how are you?

I went to the local cafe and had a double espresso. It was delicious. 

It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?
Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. 
I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.
Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?

Hi!
Bruhhhhhh!!!!!
I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.
A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.
Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?
 yeah 
thankyou

Hi!
you too
I'm doing OK. Looking forwards to the weekend. 
pretty bad
kind of anxious because of the weather these days. They mentioned that the whole city will experience harsh weather and that people in the outskirts will probably not get much rain and wind
yeah, it'll be good weather for staying inside with a cup of hot chocolate. Too bad my street usually floods, so I'll have to check for that
I live at the bottom of the valley, cheap area but we do get affected by this kind of stuff a lot haha
well, the food around the area is amazing, which is definitely a plus.
Hi!
great! just came back from a ski trip
I slammed onto an ice wall, but I got better and turning after that haha
Oh cool! do you know any french? I used to take french in high school but basically forgot most of it
I forgot 
I visited a few places like the Stade Olympique: 
yes
Barely I don't think I can, in conscience, call it that I kind of just pull myself along the sides
hahah
not at all, but I want to practice more alright. I gotta go!
I liked talking to you too!
Hi
my friends are gonna visit me this weekend. we might go hiking!
User:very depressing plans ... stay home and work I have a project deadline very close.
Right, very anxious! 
 im trying
thankyou bot
bye
Hi.
How are you? How is your day?
I'm dressed very wel today so I feel good! I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook.
Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor. Do you have good advice for positivity?
great advices thankyou
Hi!
I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.
yeah. 
Yea, I know they love the plastic bag sound all the time. I am good, nothing special though.
If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?
I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.
I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.
If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions
Maybe alcohol is such a thing.
Oops. I won't do it again. 
I know
hi 
Iâ€™m sad
yes
Iâ€™m going through a breakup

Hey, how's it going?
My day is good. A bit sad that it gets dark so early but oh well. 
Ended up going to watch a movie.
Knives Out. It had Daniel Craig and one of the famous Captain America "Chris" person (I can't keep track of all of the famous Chris names).
yeah I donâ€™t overthink anymore
I know. But sometimes I get pretty stressed over things
how can I handle stressful situations 
whats that?
I will try that
okay. See you
